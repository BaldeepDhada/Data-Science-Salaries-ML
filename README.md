Ran Machine Learning models such as Classification trees, Random Forest, Lasso and Boosting to predict the charges variable using the remainder of the predictors in the data set with a 70/30 testing split. Determined the best model for the data set by analyzing the long run mean squared error of each model by plotting the MSE.
